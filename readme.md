# Yugioh Cards

Easily download and organize all Yugioh cards

## Usage

If building from source isn't your thing, there's a binary version (only windows right now) downloadable from the releases page.

Otherwise, simply get the latest version of python (tested on 3) and you'll be good to go.

From here, run the script and cards should start downloading.
